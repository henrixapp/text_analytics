We propose a new task of personalized recipe generation to help these users: expanding a name and incomplete ingredient details into complete natural-text instructions aligned with the user{'}s historical preferences. We attend on technique- and recipe-level representations of a user{'}s previously consumed recipes, fusing these {`}user-aware{'} representations in an attention fusion layer to control recipe text generation. Experiments on a new dataset of 180K recipes and 700K interactions show our model{'}s ability to generate plausible and personalized recipes compared to non-personalized baselines.",

  abstract    = {The amount of text that is generated every day is increasing dramatically. This tremendous volume of mostly unstructured text cannot be simply processed and perceived by computers. Therefore, efficient and effective techniques and algorithms are required to discover useful patterns. Text mining is the task of extracting meaningful information from text, which has gained significant attentions in recent years. In this paper, we describe several of the most fundamental text mining tasks and techniques including text pre-processing, classification and clustering. Additionally, we briefly explain text mining in biomedical and health care domains.},

Many recipe sharing sites have devoted to the development of recipe recommendation mechanism. While most food related research has been on recipe recommendation, little effort has been done on analyzing the correlation between recipe cuisines and ingredients. In this paper, we aim to investigate the underlying cuisine-ingredient connections by exploiting the classification techniques, including associative classification and support vector machine. Our study conducted on food.com data provides insights about which cuisines are the most similar and what are the essential ingredients for a cuisine, with an application to automatic cuisine labeling for recipes.},

abstract = {Human beings have developed a diverse food culture. Many factors like ingredients, visual appearance, courses (e.g., breakfast and lunch), flavor and geographical regions affect our food perception and choice. In this work, we focus on multi-dimensional food analysis based on these food factors to benefit various applications like summary and recommendation. For that solution, we propose a delicious recipe analysis framework to incorporate various types of continuous and discrete attribute features and multi-modal information from recipes. First, we develop a Multi-Attribute Theme Modeling (MATM) method, which can incorporate arbitrary types of attribute features to jointly model them and the textual content. We then utilize a multi-modal embedding method to build the correlation between the learned textual theme features from MATM and visual features from the deep learning network. By learning attribute-theme relations and multi-modal correlation, we are able to fulfill different applications, including (1) flavor analysis and comparison for better understanding the flavor patterns from different dimensions, such as the region and course, (2) region-oriented multi-dimensional food summary with both multi-modal and multi-attribute information and (3) multi-attribute oriented recipe recommendation. Furthermore, our proposed framework is flexible and enables easy incorporation of arbitrary types of attributes and modalities. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed method and framework on the collected Yummly dataset.},
