# Milestone 1

**Title:** Clustering and augmenting recipes

**Team Members:** Christian Heusel, Henrik Reinstädtler, Tom Rix

**Mail Adresses:** {c.heusel, reinstaedtler, rix}@stud.uni-heidelberg.de

**Existing Code Fragments:** So far, we don't use any existing code, only the libraries mentioned in the [requirements.txt](../requirements.txt)

**Utilized libraries:** Uses libraries can be found in [requirements.txt](../requirements.txt)

**Contributions:** We pair-programmed some of the data analysis notebooks and gained insight into the datasets together.

## Project State

Our focus in this milestone was to get our hands on the data and have a look, how
well formatted they are and how we could prepare them for clustering.

## Data Set Analysis

We started by an in depth analysis of the selected dataset. We dropped the german
dataset, because of concerns that the different language might not be compatible 
with all methods we would like to implement for recipes in english.

The remaining five dataset sources are presented in the following:

| Name | Source | Short description | Some selected numbers |
| ---- | ------ | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| [Epicurious](datasets/epicurious.md) | | | |
| [food.com](datasets/foodcom.md) | source | | |
| [recipe1m+](datasets/foodcom.md) | | | |
| [recipe1m+ Nutritional](datasets/recipe1m_nutritional.md) | | | |
| [recipebox](datasets/recipebox.md) | | | | 
| [yummly.com](datasets/yummlycom.md) | | | |
