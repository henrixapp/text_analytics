# Milestone 1

Our focus in this milestone was to get our hands on the data and have a look, how
well formatted they are and how we could prepare them for clustering.
## Data Set Analysis

We started by an in depth analysis of the selected dataset. We dropped the german
dataset, because of concerns that the different language might not be compatible 
with all methods we would like to implement for recipes in english.

The remaining five dataset sources are presented in the following:

| Name | Source | Short description | Some selected numbers |
| ---- | ------ | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| [Epicurious](datasets/epicurious.md) | | | |
| [food.com](datasets/foodcom.md) | source | | |
| [recipe1m+](datasets/foodcom.md) | | | |
| [recipebox](datasets/recipebox.md) | | | | 
| [yummly.com](datasets/yummlycom.md) | | | |
