## [Project](src/README.md)

In our project we are clustering and augmenting recipes. A detailed description of the project idea can be found in the [proposal](proposal/project-proposal.pdf). An overview over the progress and an analysis of the dataset in particular can be found in our report for the [first milestone](milestone-1/README.md). To get started with running the example pipelines [read more here](src/README.md).
