## [Project](src/README.md)

To get started with running the example pipelines [read more here](src/README.md). Our project implementation is found in the [src folder](src/README.md) together with a [README](src/README.md), where all important steps are described.

In our project we are clustering and augmenting recipes. A detailed description of the project idea can be found in the [proposal](proposal/project-proposal.pdf). An overview over the progress and an analysis of the dataset in particular can be found in our report for the [first milestone](milestone-1/README.md). Our issue tracking and meetings are documented in the folder [meetings](meetings/).

### Appetizer
Just to give a taste, here is a clustering visualization using UMAP,k-Means and baseline approach (TF-IDF, TruncatedSVD).
